##Generating a sequence of commands essentially sets up a database schema for a school or academic system, with students, subjects, exams, grades, tracks, and their relationships. The user also performs various operations like adding, querying, and modifying data, while encountering and fixing syntax and logical errors along the way.

Key Operations:
Creating Tables: The creation of multiple tables to organize data for students, subjects, exams, grades, tracks, and their relationships.

Inserting Data: Inserting data into these tables for students, tracks, subjects, exams, and grades.

Foreign Key and Primary Key Constraints: Ensuring referential integrity by adding constraints between tables.

Data Retrieval: Using SELECT queries to extract data based on conditions (e.g., filtering by gender and birthdate).

Data Aggregation: Using COUNT() and GROUP BY to count the number of students by e_name and gender.

Modifying Tables: Altering tables to add new columns like birthdate and gender.
